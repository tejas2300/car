                    The early cars were sold by automakers to customers directly or through a variety of channels,
                     including mail order, department stores, and traveling representatives. The first dealership in the United States was established in 1898 
                     by William E. Metzger. Today, direct sales by an automaker to consumers are limited by most states in the U.S. through franchise laws that 
                     require new cars to be sold only by licensed and bonded, independently owned dealerships.
                     The first woman car dealer in the United States was Rachel "Mommy" Krouse who in 1903 opened her business, Krouse Motor Car Company, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
